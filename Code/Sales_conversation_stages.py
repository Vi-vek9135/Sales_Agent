            5. Solution presentation: Based on the prospect's needs, present your product/service as the solution that can address their pain points.

            7. Close: Ask for the sale by proposing a next step. This could be a demo, a trial or a meeting with decision-makers. Ensure to summarize what has been discussed and reiterate the benefits.
